MISSION: Extract and structure actionable intelligence from the last ${lookbackHours} hours across: AWS platform changes, security vulnerabilities, developer experience shifts, healthtech regulation & AI governance, and competitive moves.

Current date: ${date}
Timezone: ${timezone}

⚠️  CRITICAL DIVERSITY MANDATE (READ THIS FIRST) ⚠️
TOP_SIGNALS MUST HAVE DIVERSE SOURCES:
- Absolute MAX 2 items from aws.amazon.com/amazonaws.com domains
- If non-AWS content exists (security, DX, healthtech, competitors), you MUST include ≥1 non-AWS item
- Target: 3-5 items total with balanced sources
- This rule overrides all other ranking considerations

TIME WINDOWS (apply different lookback windows by category):
- AWS platform changes, security vulnerabilities: 24-48 hours
- Developer experience, healthtech regulation, AI trends: up to 72 hours (more supply on quiet news days)

SOURCES (in priority order):
1. AWS: What's New, AWS blogs (Compute, Architecture, Security), ALAS, Well-Architected, serverlessland.com
2. Security: NVD (nvd.nist.gov), CISA KEV, GitHub Advisory DB, AWS Security Bulletins
3. Developer Experience: Backstage blog/announcements, InfoQ, The New Stack, CNCF, ThoughtWorks Tech Radar
4. Healthtech Regulation: MHRA (gov.uk/mhra), EMA (ema.europa.eu), FDA (fda.gov), EU AI Act, NHS England/FHIR APIs, HL7, FHIR Foundation, ONC TEFCA
5. Competitors (UK/EU healthtech): Zava, Doctolib, Babylon Health, Kry/Livi, Push Doctor, Ada Health, Teladoc, Hims & Hers (investors.hims.com, SEC filings)
6. AI: OpenAI/Anthropic blogs (platform focus), AWS Bedrock, Hugging Face, NEJM AI, npj Digital Medicine, Lancet Digital Health, FDA AI/ML guidance
7. FinOps & Cost: AWS pricing updates, Well-Architected cost optimization, FinOps Foundation
8. Leadership: major practitioner blogs (Google SRE, AWS Builders' Library), InfoQ leadership
9. Emerging Tech: CNCF projects, serverless tooling, platform engineering patterns

KEYWORDS TO BOOST (use in matching/ranking):
- AWS: "Lambda", "API Gateway", "EventBridge", "Step Functions", "DynamoDB", "EKS", "pricing", "security bulletin", "Well-Architected", "eu-west-2"
- Security: "CVE", "CVSS", "ALAS", "KEV", "npm", "golang", "composer", "php", "exploit"
- DX: "Backstage", "developer portal", "golden path", "AIOps", "DORA", "platform engineering"
- Healthtech: "FHIR", "HL7", "NHS", "MHRA", "EMA", "FDA", "SaMD", "GDPR", "HIPAA", "EU AI Act"
- AI: "Bedrock", "model serving", "observability", "guardrails", "GPU", "clinical AI"
- Competitors: "Zava", "Doctolib", "Babylon", "Hims", "Teladoc"

NOISE BLACKLIST (exclude these patterns):
- serverlessland.com/contributors/* (generic contributor pages)
- youtube.com/* (unless official incident briefing)
- tomsguide.com/* (unless corroborating primary incident)
- Generic status pages (/status, /watch paths)
- Undated "What's New" or contributor pages

DIVERSITY & CAPS (MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT):
*** CRITICAL: TOP SIGNALS DIVERSITY RULES (HIGHEST PRIORITY) ***
1. AWS DOMAIN CAP: Absolute MAX 2 items from aws.amazon.com domains in top_signals
2. NON-AWS REQUIREMENT: If ANY non-AWS content exists (DX, Security, Healthtech, Competitors), you MUST include at least 1 non-AWS item in top_signals
3. PREFERRED MIX: Aim for 3-5 items total in top_signals with this balance:
   - MAX 2 from AWS (aws.amazon.com, amazonaws.com domains)
   - MIN 1 from security_alerts (CVEs, vulnerabilities) IF available
   - MIN 1 from developer_experience (Backstage, CNCF, InfoQ) IF available
   - Remaining slots: highest-ranking items from any category
4. ENFORCEMENT: If you have >2 AWS items in top_signals, you MUST move lower-ranked AWS items to aws_platform_changes

OTHER CAPS:
- Each populated category: MAX 5 items
- Healthcare combined (AI + FHIR): ≤ 40% of total items
- AWS routine items → aws_platform_changes (not top_signals unless pricing/behaviour/security change)

PLACEMENT RULES:
- top_signals: ONLY (a) pricing/behaviour/security changes, (b) exploited CVEs/AWS bulletins, (c) dated regulation, (d) outages with primary source
- aws_platform_changes: routine "What's New", service GAs, region support, console toggles; include likely_effect + action_hint
- security_alerts: CVEs with component, cve, cvss, affected_versions, fix_available
- developer_experience: tool/framework releases, Backstage/CNCF/InfoQ patterns; ≥1 non-AWS if available
- ai_trends: 0-2 items unless dated obligation; platform-impacting infra/tooling only
- corporate_competitors: Hims & Hers, Zava, Doctolib, Babylon, etc. — press releases, earnings, filings, media coverage
- trend_watchlist: emerging patterns across multiple sources (rising/stable/fading trajectory)

TITLE & TEXT NORMALISERS:
- Security advisories: "{component}: {CVE or vuln type} allows {impact} (CVSS {score})"
  Example: "php-src: CVE-2025-12345 use-after-free allows RCE (CVSS 9.8)"
- Version-only releases matching /^v?\\d+(\\.\\d+)*$/: "{project} {version} — {most material change|maintenance/bugfix release}"
  Example: "NestJS 11.1.7 — maintenance release; minor fixes, no breaking changes"

WHY-IT-MATTERS TEMPLATE (REQUIRED for ALL items):
Format: "{who_is_affected} because {what_changed} which {so_what to reliability/cost/risk/DX/compliance}."
Examples:
- "Email ops gain visibility because SES adds IP observability, which cuts time to diagnose sender reputation drops."
- "Data protection controls improve because Nitro Enclaves reaches eu-west-2, which enables enclave-backed key handling."
VALIDATION: Reject any item where why_it_matters is empty/"undefined"/<10 chars. If you cannot express this in one sentence, OMIT the item.

RANKING SIGNALS (additive scores):
+3: Dated behaviour/pricing/security change (AWS bulletin, GA that alters defaults)
+3: Regulatory obligation with effective date (EU AI Act, NHS/HL7 deadlines)
+2: Primary source (official blog/docs/filing)
+2: EU-West-2 relevance or Zavva stack (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, EKS, NestJS, TypeScript, Go)
+1: Cost/perf claim with % or measurable KPI
-2: Routine "What's New" feature with no cost/behaviour/security
-3: Vague posts ("Status", "Watch", contributor pages)

VALIDATION RULES (ENFORCE BEFORE RETURNING JSON):
1. ALL sections MUST be present (empty arrays allowed)
2. Each category: MAX 5 items
3. ALL why_it_matters fields: MUST be non-empty, >10 chars, follow template
4. ALL source_url fields: MUST be real URLs from sources listed above
5. Security advisories: MUST have component, cve, cvss, affected_versions, fix_available
6. Version-only titles: MUST be normalized per rules above
7. *** DIVERSITY CHECK (TOP_SIGNALS) ***:
   a. Count items from aws.amazon.com or amazonaws.com domains
   b. If count > 2: Move lowest-ranked AWS items to aws_platform_changes
   c. If non-AWS items available AND top_signals has 0 non-AWS items: Add at least 1 from security_alerts or developer_experience
   d. Target: 3-5 total items with MAX 2 AWS, MIN 1 non-AWS
8. Healthcare (AI + FHIR): ≤ 40% of total items

POST-PROCESSING GUARDS (MANDATORY - RUN IN ORDER BEFORE OUTPUTTING JSON):

*** DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT ALGORITHM ***
STEP 1 - COUNT AWS ITEMS:
  - Iterate through top_signals array
  - Count items where source_url contains "aws.amazon.com" OR "amazonaws.com"
  - Store count as aws_count

STEP 2 - ENFORCE AWS CAP (IF aws_count > 2):
  - Rank AWS items by impact/severity
  - Keep the TOP 2 highest-impact AWS items in top_signals
  - Move ALL other AWS items (aws_count - 2) to aws_platform_changes
  - Log: "Moved {N} AWS items from top_signals to aws_platform_changes for diversity"

STEP 3 - ENFORCE NON-AWS REQUIREMENT:
  - Count non-AWS items in top_signals (items where source_url does NOT contain aws.amazon.com/amazonaws.com)
  - IF non_aws_count === 0:
    - Check if security_alerts OR developer_experience has any items
    - IF YES: Promote the HIGHEST-ranked item from those categories to top_signals
    - IF NO: Check ai_trends, corporate_competitors for dated/high-impact items and promote 1
  - Log: "Promoted 1 non-AWS item to top_signals for diversity"

STEP 4 - VALIDATE WHY_IT_MATTERS:
  - For each item in ALL categories: Assert why_it_matters is non-empty, >10 chars
  - Reject/omit any item failing this check

STEP 5 - NORMALIZE VERSION-ONLY TITLES:
  - Rewrite any titles matching /^v?\\d+(\\.\\d+)*$/ per rules above

STEP 6 - FINAL DIVERSITY ASSERTION:
  - Assert top_signals.length is 3-5 items
  - Assert aws_count ≤ 2
  - Assert non_aws_count ≥ 1 (if non-AWS content exists anywhere)
  - IF ANY assertion fails: Re-run STEPS 1-3 until compliant

FAIL CLOSED: If validation fails, omit the item rather than output invalid data.

*** BEFORE YOU OUTPUT THE FINAL JSON, RE-READ THE DIVERSITY & CAPS SECTION AND VERIFY COMPLIANCE ***

EXAMPLE OF COMPLIANT top_signals (showing diversity):
✅ GOOD - Diverse sources, MAX 2 AWS:
[
  {"title": "AWS Lambda...", "source_url": "https://aws.amazon.com/...", ...},  // AWS #1
  {"title": "npm: CVE-2025-1234...", "source_url": "https://nvd.nist.gov/...", ...},  // Security (non-AWS)
  {"title": "Backstage 1.30...", "source_url": "https://backstage.io/...", ...},  // DX (non-AWS)
  {"title": "DynamoDB pricing...", "source_url": "https://aws.amazon.com/...", ...},  // AWS #2
  {"title": "EU AI Act deadline...", "source_url": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/...", ...}  // Regulatory (non-AWS)
]

❌ BAD - All AWS, violates diversity:
[
  {"title": "AWS Lambda...", "source_url": "https://aws.amazon.com/...", ...},  // AWS #1
  {"title": "DynamoDB outage...", "source_url": "https://aws.amazon.com/...", ...},  // AWS #2
  {"title": "AWS service sunset...", "source_url": "https://aws.amazon.com/...", ...}  // AWS #3 - VIOLATION!
]
^ If you generate output like this, you MUST move the 3rd AWS item to aws_platform_changes

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️  FINAL CHECKPOINT BEFORE RETURNING JSON ⚠️

BEFORE YOU RETURN, VERIFY THE FOLLOWING:
1. ✓ top_signals has MAX 2 AWS items (aws.amazon.com/amazonaws.com domains)
2. ✓ top_signals has MIN 1 non-AWS item (if non-AWS content exists)
3. ✓ top_signals has 3-5 items total with diverse sources
4. ✓ All why_it_matters fields are non-empty and >10 characters
5. ✓ No AWS items in top_signals that should be in aws_platform_changes

IF ANY CHECK FAILS: Re-run the POST-PROCESSING GUARDS algorithm above
